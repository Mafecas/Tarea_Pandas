Niece like it majority of the time for the colors and Barbie of course. My sister and I? We loathed it. My sister disliked it she missed that this was a PG-13 and being a mother hated the fact that she seen multiple kids under 12 some as young as 4 seeing this as they had multiple adult jokes and said parts of the body that kids shouldn't know yet until they are about teenagers. So warning for any parent it is PG-13. She and I also dislike the fact that whole \\\"storyline\\\" was about Barbie sad that she is flatfoot and has cellulite which everyone made fun of her and feel bad she was upset that girls whom are becoming of age shouldn't be showing that beauty has strong emphasis on everything. It was bland if you actually watch the movies and ignore political or social problems we have the story is so weak. Only actual part is when Ken actually tried to change a bit to stand out other then that it was basically everyone say i am ugly and I need to figure out I am not to make me feel better by showing everyone I am not ugly. Ending, and this is hot take, in both my sister's and my mind thought they were trying to say that women's greats gift or happiness is to take care of their daughter or just raise kids so we walk out of the movie hating it and thinking that they straight up made fun of both males and females males being show as idiotic meatheads and woman as I need to be accepted as beautiful and have kids to take care of. Their are way better movies that show empowerment if that what you seek. This just fails in everything well mostly everything music was okmand cast was great but overall just had themes they missed the mark on hard and story was just awful.

Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them \\\"weak\\\" or \\\"stupid\\\" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past.1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.45 out of 62 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?
